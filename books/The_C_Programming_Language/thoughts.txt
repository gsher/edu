# K&R -- The C Programming Language

## Before

I am excited to start this book. When I was just a kid, I attempted to learn C, 
but it just wasn't happening for me. Now, years later, after detours with 
Python, Java, and C#, I get to return to the granddaddy of them all. K&R is 
simply the default C book, and I am excited to get started.
