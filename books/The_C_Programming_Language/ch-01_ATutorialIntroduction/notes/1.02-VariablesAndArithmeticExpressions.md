# Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

Introducing a new program, to calculate farenheit/centigrade temperatures

- Comments are contained between `/*` and `*/`
- In C, all variables must be declared before they are used
	- C provides a variety of types:
		- `int`: integer
		- `float`: floating point
		- `char`: character--single byte
		- `short`: short integer
		- `long`: long integer
		- `double`: double-precision float

## Temperature program

Our program begins with assignments

```C
lower = 0;
upper = 300;
step = 20;
fahr = lower;
```

Following is a `while` loop

```C
while (fahf <= upper) {
	...
}
```
Within the while loop, we have the Celsius calculation

```C
celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
```

Why not just multipy by `5/9`? 
__integer division truncates the fractional part__
5/9 will truncate to 0.

We see a bit more about `printf`. `%d` specifies an integer argument.

```C
printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
```

`printf` is not part of C. There is no input or output defined by C.
`printf` comes from the standard library.
