# Hello World

> The only way to learn a new language is by writing programs in it.

- Compiling my program produces the executable `a.out`
	- is this universal? I don't know yet
- A C program consists of _functions_ and _variables_
- All C programs must contain `main()`
	- Execution begins with `main()`

```C
#include <stdio.h>

main(){
	printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

- The first line of the program tells the compiler to include information about the standard I/O library
- A sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes is a _character string_ or _string constant_

## Excercises

1. Run the hello.c proogram
	- Compiler produces a warning that `main` requires a type specifier
	- I assume this means it needs to return a status code
2. What hapens when \c is used in printf, when c is not t,b,", or \
	- Gives a warning, "unknown escape sequence"
	- When run, it just ignores the backslash
