# Symbolic Constants

It is bad form to bury "magic numbers" in a program. It is better to
define them with meaningful names.

`#define` defines a _symbolic name_ or _symbolic constant_ to be a 
particular string of characters.

`#define` _name_ _replacement text_

Thereafter, any occurrence of _name_ will be replaced by the corresponding
_replacement text_.

```C
#define	LOWER	0
#define	UPPER	300
#define	STEP	20

for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP) {
	...
}
```
