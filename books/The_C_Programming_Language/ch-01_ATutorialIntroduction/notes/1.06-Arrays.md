# Arrays

Let's write a program! It will count the number of occurrences of each 
digit, of white space characters (blank, tab, new line), and all
other characters.

We have 12 categories of input, so it's more convenient to use an array
than ten individual variables.

Here is a version of the program:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

/* Counts digits, whitespace, others */
main(){
	int c, i, nwhite, nother;
	int ndigit[10];
	nwhite = nother = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		ndigit[i] = 0;

	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
		if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
			++ndigit[c-'0'];
		else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
			++nwhite;
		else
			++nother;
	
	printf("digits =");
	for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
	printf(", whitespace = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother);
}
```

`char` is really just a small integer, so the value of each digit as a 
char is incrementally larger than the one preceding it. Therefore, if we
have '1' - '0', 0 is some value `v` and 1 immediately follows 0, and is
one larger than the value `v`. '1' - '0' is 1 because the character value
is one larger than the character value of 0. It doesn't matter what
value is assigned to the digits as long as they are successive values.

## Excercises

1-13. Write a program that prints a histogram of the lengths of values in
the input. Try both vertical and horizontal.
