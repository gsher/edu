# Arguments - Call by Value

>In C, all arguments are passed "by value"

This means, the called function is given the values of its arguments
in temporary variables rather than the originals. In C, a function cannot
directly alter a variable in the calling function. It can only alter its
private, temporary copy. This can be used to our advantage.

```C
/* power: raise base to n-th power; n >= 0; version 2 */
int power(int base, int n)
{
	int p;

	for (p = 1; n > 0; --n)
		p = p * base;
	return p;
}
```

What is done to `n` in this case does not affect the original argument 
passed in when the function was called.

The varible passed in an argument _can_ be modified by a called function,
if the caller provides an the _address_ of the variable to be modified
(technically a _pointer_ to a variable). The function must declare the 
parameter to be a pointer.

When an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function
is the location of the beginning of the array. This is a topic for the
next section.
