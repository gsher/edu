# Variable Names

Variable name restrictions:

- made up of letters and digits
- underscore counts as a letter
	- don't begin variable names with an underscore
- uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct
- convention dictates lowercase varible names and caps for symbolic constants

It's wise to use a name related to the variable's function. The tendency
is to use short names for local variables and loop indices, and long 
names for external variables.
