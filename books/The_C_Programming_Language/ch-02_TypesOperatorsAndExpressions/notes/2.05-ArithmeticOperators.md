# Arithmetic Operators

The binart arithmetic operators are +, -, \*, /, and the modulus 
operator, %. __Integer division truncates any fractional portion__. The 
expression 
```
  x % y
```
produces the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The `%` operator cannot be 
applied to a `float` or `double`. The direction of truncation for `/` and
the sign of the result of `%` is machine-dependant for negative operands.
