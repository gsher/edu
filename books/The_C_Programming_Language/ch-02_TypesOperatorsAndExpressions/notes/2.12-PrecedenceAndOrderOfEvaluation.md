# Precedence and Order of Evaluation

There is a table about precedence. I am not going to type it.

There is no guarantee when things are evaluated. `x = f() + g();` does not
guarantee `f` will be evaluated before `g` or vice versa. If `g` or `f` 
alters a variable that the other depends on, the result will depend on 
order of computation, which is never guaranteed.

Same goes for a statement as follows
```C
printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n));
```
The result will depend on which compiler was used. The same ambiguity 
exists with 
```C
a[i] = i++;
```

The moral of the story is to never write code that depends on order of 
execution.
