# Declarations

> All variables must be declared before use, although certain declarations
> can be made implicitly by context

A declaration contains a `type`, and contains a list of one or more 
variables of that type. 
```C
int lower, upper, step;
char c, line[1000];
```
Variables can also be initialized when it is declared.
```C
char	esc = '\\';
int	i = 0;
int	limit = MAXLINE+1;
float	eps = 1.0e-5;
```
The qualifier `const` can be applied to any variable to indicate it won't
be changed. `const` applied to an array indicates its values won't change.
```C
const double e = 2.71828182845905;
const char msg[] = "warning: ";
```
`const` can be used with array arguments to indicate the array will not be
altered.
```C
int strlen(const char[]);
```
When arrays are passed to an array, the reference is passed, so if it is 
changed, is changes the same instance of the array thayt was passed in.
`const` prevents that.

The result of attempting to modify `const` is dependent on the 
implementation. The result on my mac is a compiler error: `read-only 
variable is not assignable`.
