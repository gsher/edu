# Type Conversions

When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a 
common type. The only automatic conversions are when converting a 
"narrower" type into a "wider" one without losing information, such as 
converting an integer to a floating point.

A `char` is just a small integer, so it can freely be used in arithmetic 
expressions. This makes for some flexible character transformations, such
as this naive implementation of the function `atoi`, a way to convert a 
string of digits into its numeric equivalent.

```C
/* atoi: convert s to an integer */
int atoi(char s[])
{
	int i, n;

	n = 0;
	for (i = 0; s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9'; ++i)
		n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0');
	return n;
}
```

Another example of `char`-`int` conversion is the function `lower`, to 
convert letters to their lowercase counterparts _in ASCII_.

```C
/* lower: convert c to lowercase; ASCII only */
int lower(int c)
{
	if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
		return c + 'a' - 'A';
	else
		return c;
}
```

The standard header `<ctype.h>` provides character set-independent set of
test and conversion functions. `tolower(c)` is a portable version of the 
above `lower` in `<ctype.h>`. There is also `isdigit(c)`, which is a 
replacement for `c >= '0' && c <= '9'`.

We will use the `<ctype.h>` functions from now on. 

Conversions also take place in assignments.

Conversions can also be made explicitly: `sqrt((double)n)`
