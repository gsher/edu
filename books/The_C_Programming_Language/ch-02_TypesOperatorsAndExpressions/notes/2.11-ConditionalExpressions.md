# Conditional Expressions

The statements
```C
if (a > b)
	z = a;
else
	z = b;
```
compute in `z` the maximum of `a` and `b`. The _ternary operator_ provides
an alternate way to write this and similar constructs. It is formatted as
`condition ? a : b` where the value of the expression is `a` if the 
condition is true and `b` if it is false. Rewriting the above expression,
```C
z = (a > b) ? a : b;
```

# Excercises
- 2-10. Rewrite the function `lower`, which converts upper case letters to
lower case, using a conditional expression
```C
/* lower: convert c to lowercase */
int lower(int c)
{
	return (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') ? c+'a'-'A' : c;
}
```
