# Bitwise Operators

C provides six bitwise manipulation operators. These can be applied 
to signed and unsigned integral operands: `char`, `short`, `int`, and
`long`. 
```
	&	bitwise AND
	|	bitwise OR
	^	bitwise exclusive OR
	<<	left shift
	>>	right shift
	-	one's complement (unary)
```
The bitwise AND operator is often used to mask off some set of bits;
for example,
```C
n = n & 0177;
```
sets to zero all but the low-order 7 bits of `n`.

The bitwise OR operator is used to turn bits on:
```C
x = x | SET_ON;
```
sets the bits that are 1 in `SET_ON` to 1 in `x`.

The bitwise exclusive OR operator sets a 1 in each bit position where
its operands have different bits and 0 where they are the same.

The k+r explanations are gibberish to me, so I did some research. I 
will try to notate my discoveries, within the context of k+r.

All of these operands are operating on binary representations of 
integers. Assuming 8bit/1byte integers,
```
int x = 19;
binary x = 00010011;
```
We'll assume we are operating on `x` with the octal `a`.
```
int a = 077;
binary a = 00111111;
```
Now working through the different operators:
```
x | 00010011 dec: 19
a | 00111111 dec: 61
------------
& | 00010011 dec: 19 // collect bits present in both

x | 00010011 dec: 19
a | 00111111 dec: 61
------------
| | 00111111 dec: 61 // collect bits present in either

x | 00010011 dec: 19
a | 00111111 dec: 61
------------
^ | 00101100 dec: 44 // collect bits in __only__ one or the other
```
From what I've seen, these operators show their use when they are
useful. There aren't really any canned responses for "this is great
when ...". An interesting application is making symbolic constants
as follows
```C
enum traits { LEADER = 1, BRAVE = 2, SCARED = 4,
		SERIOUS = 8, LAZY = 16, FRIEND = 32 };
```
and then passing certain values is easy:
```C
void lion_o(int traits);
void snarf(int traits);

lion_o(LEADER | BRAVE | SERIOUS | FRIEND);
	/* traits = 00101011; */
snarf(SCARED | LAZY | FRIEND);
	/* traits = 00110100; */

void snarf(int traits)
{
	if ((traits & SCARED) == SCARED){
		/* traits	00110100
		*  SCARED	00000100
		*  bitwise AND	00000100 dec: 4 */

		/* snarf is scared! */
	}
}
```
This is different from a series of parameters to specify which 
attributes apply.

`~` is the unary operator, and it flips all bits
```
int a = 077;	// bin: 00111111
int b = ~a;	// bin: 11000000

x = x & ~077; 	// flips last six bits of x to 0
		// OCT  077 == BIN 00111111
		// OCT ~077 == BIN 11000000
		
x    | 01010110
~077 | 11000000 // equal to 0177700
AND  | 01000000
```
Expressions such as `x & ~077` are better than `x & 0177700`, because
the second is dependant on x being a 16-bit integer. The first is 
more portable.

As an illustration of some of the bitwise operators, we have the 
function `getbits(x,p,n)` which returns the (right-adjusted) `n`-bit
field of `x` that pegins at position `p`. For example, 
`getbits(x,4,3)` returns the three bits in bit positions 4, 3 and 2,
right adjusted.
```C
/* getbits: return n bits from position p */
unsigned getbits(unsigned x, int p, int n)
{
	return (x >> (p+1-n)) & ~(~0 << n);
}
```

# Excercises 
- 2-6. Write a function `setbits(x,p,n,y)` that returns `x` with the
`n` bits that begin at position `p` set to the rightmost `n` bits of
`y`, leaving the other bits unchanged
```C
unsigned setbits(unsigned x, int p, int n, int y)
{
	return y << (p+1-n) | (x & ((~0 << p+1) | ~(~0 << (p+1-n))));
}
```
- 2-7. Write a function `invert(x,p,n)` that returns `x` with the `n`
bits that begin at position `p` inverted, leaving the others 
unchanged
```C
unsigned invert(unsigned x, int p, int n)
{
	return x ^ (x & ~((~0 << p+1) | ~(~0 << (p+1-n))));
}
```
- 2-8. Write a function `rightrot(x,n)` that returns the value of the
integer `x` rotated to the right by `n` bit positions
```C
/* assuming 16 is the number of bits in an unsigned integer */
unsigned rightrot(unsigned x, int n)
{
	return x << n | ((~(~0 << n) & x) << 16 - n);
}
```
