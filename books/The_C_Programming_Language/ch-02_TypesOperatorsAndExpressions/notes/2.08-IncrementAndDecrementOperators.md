# Increment and Decrement Operators

C provides two unusual operaters for decrementing and incrementing
variables. `++` adds one to a variable, and `--` subtracts one. They
can be used both before or after the variable, as a prefix operator
or as a postfix operator. `++n` increments `n` _before_ its use, and
`n++` increments _after_.

If `n == 5`, `x = ++n` sets `x` to 6. `x = n++` sets `x` to 5. In 
both cases, `n == 6`.

The increment operators can only be applied to variables, not 
expressions. 

If accumulating is all that's required, there's no difference between
pre- and postfix operators. However, some applications depend on one
or the other. Consider `squeeze`, a function to eliminate all 
occurances of a character from a string.
```C
/* squeeze: delete all c from s */
void squeeze(char s[], int c)
{
	int i, j;

	for (i = j = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
		if (s[i] != c)
			s[j++] = s[i];
	s[j] = '\0';
}
```

- 2-4. Write an alternate version of `squeeze(s1, s2)` that deletes
any character in `s1` that matches any character in `s2`.
	- See ex\_2-04 in `programs`
- 2.5 Write a function `any(s1, s2)` that returns the first location
of any character in s2 that is in s1
	- See ex\_2-05 in `programs`
