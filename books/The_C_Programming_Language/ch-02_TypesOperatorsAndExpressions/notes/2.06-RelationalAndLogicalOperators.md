# Relational and Logical Operators

The relational operators are 
```
  >  >=  <  <=
```
They have the same precedence. One step down in precedence are the 
equality operators:
```
  ==  !=
```
Relational operators are below arithmetic operators in precedence. 
`i < lim-1` is equivalent to `i < (lim-1)`.

The logical operators `||` and `&&` are evaluated left to right, and 
evaluation stops once the truth or falseness is known. Most C programs are
dependant on this fact.

`&&` is higher in precedence than `||`. Both are lower than relational and
equality operators.

By definition, the numeric value of a relational or logical expression is
1 if true, and 0 if false.

# Excercises

```C
for (i=0; i<lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
	s[i] = c;
```
- 2-2. Write a loop equvalent to the one above without using `&&` or `||`
```C
for (i=0; (i<lim-1) == ((c=getchar()) != '\n') == (c != EOF); ++i)
	s[i] = c;
```
