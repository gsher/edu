# Assignment Operators and Expressions

Expressions such as `i = i + 2` can be expressed as `i += 2`. The 
`+=` operator is an _assignment operator_. Most binary operators
(have a left and right operand) have a corresponding assignment
operator _op_= where _op_ is one of
```
+	-	*	/	%
>>	<<	&	^	|
```
The function `bitcount` counts the number of 1-bits in its integer 
argument and serves as a good example.
```C
/* bitcount: count 1 bits in x */
int bitcount(unsigned x)
{
	int b;

	for (b = 0; x != 0; x >>= 1)
		if (x & 01)
			b++;
	return b;
}
```
Declaring `x` to be `unsigned` ensures that as it is bit-shifted,
vacated digits will be filled with zeros instead of sign bits, 
regardless of machine-dependant implementation.

We have seen before that assignment statements have value, such as
```C
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
	...
```
In all of this type of expression, the resultant type is that of the
left operand and the value is that of the right.

# Excercises
- 2-9. In a two's complement number system, `x &= (x-1)` deletes the
rightmost 1-bit in `x`. Explain why. Use this observation to write a
faster version of `bitcount`.
	- given `x = 10011011`, `x &= (x-1)` is equivalent to 
`10011011 &= 10011010`, which evaluates to `10011010`. If we perform the 
operation again, we have `10011010 &= 10011001` which evaluates to 
`10011000`. Continuing, we have `10011000 &= 10010111`, which results in
`10010000`. In all these cases, we subtract one, which forces us to take
from the right-most one-bit. Then performing the `&` operation eliminates
all the extraneous one-bits to the right, effectively eliminating the 
right-most one-bit.
```C
/* bitcountquick: a quicker bitcount using the above discovery */
int bitcountquick(unsigned x)
{
	int b;

	for (b = 0; x != 0; x &= (x-1))
		b++;
	
	return b;
}
```
