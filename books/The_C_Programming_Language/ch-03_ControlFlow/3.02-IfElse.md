# If-Else

The `if-else` statement is used to express decisions.
```
if (expression)
	statement_1
else
	statement_2
```
statement\_1 is executed if expression is non-zero.

Without braces, 
```C
if (n > 0)
	if (n % 2 == 0)
		printf("positive and even!\n");
else
	printf("negative?");
```
the else is actually associated with the inner if.

Not much else to say. It's an if statement.
