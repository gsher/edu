# Loops: For and While

We've already seen `for` and `while` loops. 
```
while (_expression_)
	_statement_
```
The statement will be executed as long as expression is zero.

The `for` statement,
```
for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
	_statement_
```
is the same as 
```
expr1;
while (expr2) {
	_statement_
	expr3;
}
```
 Usage of `while` vs. `for` is whatever's more suitable, and otherwise
 personal preference.
 
 It is possible to have multiple statements in an expression,
 separated by commas.
 
# Excercises
- 3-3. Write a function, `expand(s1,s2)`, that expands shorthand
  notations such as "a-z" into the equivalent "abc...xyz". It should
  be able to handle cases such as "a-b-c", "a-x0-9" and "-a-z". A
  leading hyphen will be taken literaly
