# Else-If

They are pretty self-explanitory.

For an example, we have a bnary search function to decide if the value `x`
occurs in the array `v`. The elements of `v` must be in increasing order.
The function returns the location and -1 if it isn't in the array.
```C
int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)
{
	int low, high, mid;

	low = 0;
	high = n - 1;
	while (low <= high) {
		mid = (low + high) / 2;
		if (x < v[mid])
			high = mid - 1;
		else if (x > v[mid])
			low = mid + 1;
		else /* found match */
			return mid;
	}
	return -1; /* no match */
}
```

# Excercises

- 3-1. Write a version of `binsearch` that uses only one test inside the 
loop. Measure the difference in runtime.
	- Implementations are in ex\_3-01.c in `programs`
	- `time classic` returns .009 seconds total
	- `time revised` returns .008 seconds total
		- These differences are negligible. I don't know how to
		get a sample big enough to expose potential differences
		without getting a segfault.
